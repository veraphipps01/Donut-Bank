### Description

This full-stack app was created as a final project for web development bootcamp. It was initially built via create-react-app and connected to backend with Express and MongoDB Cloud Solution.

 ### [See In Action](https://donut-bank.herokuapp.com/)

### Installation Guidelines

The app can be run via local server which requires the following steps: 
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Install node.js
* Run npm install (to create the node modules) in the project folder
  * Run npm install express
  * Run npm install cors
  * Run npm install mongodb
* Run node index.js (to start the server) in the project folder.  
* Browse to http://localhost:3000

### Technology used

  MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) + Heroku
     
### Features

The project's features include a dynamic navigation bar but also code specific for user context (i.e., mirroring deposits and withdrawals in the userâ€™s balance). The userContext code can be generalized to other applications where such a functionality is needed if this app is used without backend, otherwise it uses MongoDB to add new users.
